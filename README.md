### Prerequisites

Before starting, ensure you have:

### Exercise: Generate a Release Notes Prompt

**Objective:** Use Copilot's built-in `/create-prompt` command to generate a prompt file that automates release note creation from git commit history.

#### Task Description

1. Use the `/create-prompt` command in Copilot Chat to generate a prompt file that:
   - Analyzes git commits between two tags
   - Categorizes commits by type (feat, fix, docs, chore, etc.) following conventional commit format
   - Outputs the release notes as a markdown file

2. Save the generated prompt file to `.github/prompts/release-notes.prompt.md`

3. Review and revise the generated prompt file as needed.

4. Run the prompt to generate release notes between `v1.1.0` and `v1.3.0`

5. Review and verify the generated release notes. If the output is incorrect or incomplete, iterate by revising your prompt file and running again.

### Submission Requirements

Submit the following screenshots:

1. **Prompt file screenshot:** Show the saved `release-notes.prompt.md` file with its content visible

2. **Execution screenshot:** Show the prompt running with the agent executing git commands

3. **Output screenshot:** Show the generated release notes markdown file
